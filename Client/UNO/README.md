# UNO

This template has been converted to use React with Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

Use VSCode with the built-in TypeScript support or the [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) and React extensions.

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

This project uses React + TypeScript. The repo runs `tsc` to type-check the React code (see `package.json` scripts).

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vite.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```
